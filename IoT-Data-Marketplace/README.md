# IoT Data Marketplace

## Project Title
IoT Data Marketplace

## Project Description
A decentralized application (dApp) built on the Stellar blockchain for leasing physical or digital assets using Soroban smart contracts. The platform enables asset owners to lease out their items in exchange for Lumens (XLM), while smart contracts automatically handle lease terms, payments, and returns. This marketplace creates a trustless environment for IoT device owners to monetize their data and for consumers to access valuable data streams.

## Project Vision
The IoT Data Marketplace aims to revolutionize how IoT devices and their data are monetized. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a decentralized ecosystem where device owners can securely offer access to their devices or the data they produce. Our vision is to unlock the value of the billions of connected devices worldwide by creating a transparent, efficient marketplace that rewards data producers and empowers data consumers, all while maintaining data sovereignty, privacy, and security.
